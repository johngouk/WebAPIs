'''
    This Python script shows the movement of a ball repeatedly falling under the influence of
    gravity, hitting the bottom of the screen, and bouncing until it falls again. It does not
    include the effects of air resistance!
    Acceleration due to gravity (usually called "g") is 9.81 m/s/s i.e. every second, the
    speed towards the centre of the earth increases by 9.81 m/s.
    The script uses the Python Turtle implementation, where the centre of the screen is (0,0),
    up/right is +ive, down/left is -ive, width/2 > x > -width/2 and height/2 > y > -height/2.
    Thus in this model, g = -9.81, because downward speed (velocity) is in the -y direction -
    as the ball falls, y will go more negative, and after the bounce it will go less negative.
    The script converts metres into pixels using an adjustable conversion factor.
    
    The really hard problem is detecting when the ball has effectively stopped bouncing! At the
    moment the last 5 D_incr values are saved in a list, which is checked - observation of
    the output numbers indicates that if the movement is alternately up and down then things
    have pretty much stopped.
    
    The model is not continuous - it uses an adjustable time interval (T_incr) to examine the state
    of the ball after each (time interval) seconds have elapsed.

    I've experimented with different T_incr values; 0.1 is too big, the ball travels
    too far between intervals and often bounces below the line! 0.001 is too small, the ball
    moves incredibly slowly, I'm not sure why... maybe the meters_to_pixels conversion needs
    to be adjusted for different T_incr.
